# iterm_multiple_ssh_logins

This script open a new full screen iTerm window.

Splits horizontally / vertically based on 'n' and then ssh's to each of the hostnames defined in the hostnames list.

This has been tested on OSX El Capitan ( 10.11.6 ) with iTerm2 ( Build 3.1.6 ).

I have saved this file as text but in order to run it, you should open it in apple script editor and save it as .scpt.

Then move the script to ~/Library/Application\ Support/iTerm/Scripts/ folder.
If the Scripts folder does not exist, create it.

After that, reopen iTerm2 and you should see a scripts menu. Using that you can launch this script.
